# Keeper-App

Created with CodeSandbox

Client-side block for Keeper, a Single Page Appication (SPA) for saving notes, just like any NotePad.

Built out of several React components, the app runs fast, asynchronous and very fluid.

## Tools

- React.js
- React-redux
- Parcel
- axios
- Material Design (Google UI)
- https://www.transparenttextures.com/ for the background

## Deployment (how to get the project running?)

Fork it on your github account, and clone it locally.
From your Command Line Interface, 'cd' into the folder and run the first package.json script: 'npm start' . It will launch parcel and bundle up the code.
Once budled up, it will serve the file on port 3000. Run it from the browser, and the site will be there.
